% Anyway, the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you 
% need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means 
% you need to win. Good luck!"

% for part 2 I'll rebuild the game history data set and then use part 1
% code

% loop though each game and tally score
% 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors
% 3 for win, 0 for loss
